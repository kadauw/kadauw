### 01 Introduction to Additive Manufacturing

“Additive Manufacturing” (AM) is a layer-based automated fabrication process for making scaled three-dimensional physical objects directly from 3D-CAD data without using part-depending tools. It works by adding material layer by layer until the entire object is created.
The term additive manufacturing, like “Generative Manufacturing”, covers any imaginable way of adding material in order to create a 3-dimensional physical part. The technical realization of AM is based solely on layers and therefore it is called “layer-based technology”, “layer-oriented technology”, or even “layered technology”. Consequently, today the terms, additive manufacturing, generative manufacturing, and layer-based technology are used synonymously. [Gebhardt, Markforged]

As Additive Manufacturing (AM) is a comparably young technology, there were almost no efforts for standardization for many years other than some preliminary work in Germany in the early 1990s. In 2007, a special recommendation dedicated to Rapid Prototyping /VDI3404/ was created under the supervision of the German Society of Mechanical Engineers, VDI. It was published in autumn of 2008. As of 2009, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in cooperation with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) started the development of their own standardization procedures. In autumn 2009, the committee F42 on Additive Manufacturing (subcommittee F42.91 on Terminology) issued F2792‑09e1 /F2792/, also called Standard Terminology for Additive Manufacturing Technologies. Among other definitions, the name “Additive Manufacturing” was defined by this committee. [Gebhardt]


Additive manufacturing is a relatively new technology, but it is rapidly becoming more popular. This is because it offers a number of advantages over traditional manufacturing methods, such as:
•	The ability to create complex shapes that would be difficult or impossible to create with traditional methods
•	The ability to create objects with a high degree of customization
•	The ability to reduce waste material
•	The ability to produce objects on demand

### 02	History of Additive Manufacturing

Additive manufacturing, also widely known as 3D printing, has a relatively recent origin story:

1980s: The Seed is Sown The groundwork for additive manufacturing is laid in 1980 by Dr. Hideo Kodama in Japan. He files the first patent for an AM system that utilizes light-sensitive material and layering to create prototypes.

1987: Birth of Stereolithography The first commercially available additive manufacturing system emerges. It's called stereolithography (SL), developed by 3D Systems. This process uses a laser to solidify layers of light-sensitive liquid polymer.

1980s & 1990s: Branching Out New AM technologies are introduced, such as laminated object manufacturing (LOM) by Helisys. These expand the possibilities of creating 3D objects from digital models.

2000s & Onwards: Continued Growth With the rise of the internet and more affordable technologies, AM gains wider adoption. More companies and enthusiasts explore its potential for various applications.
Additive manufacturing continues to evolve with advancements in materials, machinery, and software. It's transforming many industries by enabling complex designs, customization, and on-demand production.

### 03	Processes of Additive Manufacturing

There are seven main processes of additive manufacturing and there are numerous ways to classify AM technologies. A popular approach is to classify according to baseline technology, like whether the process uses lasers, printer technology, extrusion technology, etc. and Another approach is to collect processes together according to the type of raw material input [11, 12, 13, Henning].


![Processes of Additive Manufacturing](https://www.skz.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Bilder/_Forschung/Prozess/Additive%20Fertigung/Overview-Additive-Manufacturing.png)

There are a number of different additive manufacturing processes available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The most common processes include:
Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) / Fused deposition modeling (FDM): This process uses a filament of material that is melted and deposited layer by layer. FDM is a versatile process that can be used to create objects from a wide range of materials, including plastics, metals, and ceramics.
Stereolithography (SLA): This process uses a vat of liquid resin that is cured by a laser beam. SLA is a high-resolution process that can be used to create objects with very fine details.
Selective laser sintering (SLS): This process uses a bed of powder that is sintered together by a laser beam. SLS is a good option for creating objects from metal or ceramic materials.


### 04  Applications of Additive Manufacturing

Additive manufacturing has a wide range of applications across many industries. Additive manufacturing is a rapidly growing technology with the potential to revolutionize many industries. As the technology continues to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative applications emerge. Here are some of the most common:

Prototyping: One of the most popular uses of 3D printing is in prototyping. This allows companies to create physical models of their designs quickly and easily, without the need for expensive tooling. This can save time and money during the product development process. 
Manufacturing: Additive manufacturing is increasingly being used for final-use parts, particularly in low-volume or high-complexity applications. This is because 3D printing can produce parts with complex geometries that would be difficult or impossible to manufacture using traditional methods. 

Medical: The medical field is one of the fastest-growing areas for additive manufacturing. 3D printing is being used to create a variety of medical devices, including prosthetics, implants, and surgical instruments. It is also being used to bioprint tissues and organs for transplantation. 

Aerospace: The aerospace industry is another major user of additive manufacturing. 3D printing is being used to produce lightweight, high-strength parts for aircraft and spacecraft. This can help to reduce the weight of vehicles, which can improve fuel efficiency. 
Consumer Goods: Additive manufacturing is also being used to create a variety of consumer goods, such as jewelry, toys, and sporting goods. This allows for the creation of customized products and products with complex designs. 

Architecture and Construction:  
While AM in construction is still evolving, it holds immense potential to revolutionize the industry. As technology advances and materials become more robust, we can expect to see even wider adoption of this innovative approach to building design and creation.

Arts and Design, food: AM is making waves in the creative world of Arts & Design and even the culinary scene of Food.


Examples of using AM in Industry:
In Aerospace applications
Ariane Group: 3D printing, particularly with metals, is increasingly being used in the manufacture of rockets. The technology is enabling engineers to innovate the design of rocket parts and manufacture them in a shorter time frame. One example of this is an injector head for the Ariane 6 launcher, developed by Ariane Group, a joint venture of Airbus Group and Safran. An injector head is one of the core elements of a propulsion module, which forces the fuel mixture into the combustion chamber. Traditionally, injector heads are made from dozens or even hundreds of parts, which need to be machined and welded together. In contrast, 3D printing enables these components to be manufactured as a single piece. In the case of the injector head for the Ariane 6 launcher, the team took a design that originally required 248 components and reduced it down to one 3D-printed part. The material used for the part was a nickel-based alloy. 

Airbus: 3D-printed plastic parts can be incredibly useful for aerospace applications, such as aircraft interiors.
The cabin interiors of a commercial aircraft will need to be updated periodically, a process that can involve replacing components like wall panels. The need for customisation means that parts will typically be produced in low volumes. Quick turnaround times are also a must. A good example of this is Airbus. As of 2018, the company has produced and is set to install3D-printed spacer panelson its commercial A320 aircraft. Traditionally, new plastic components would be produced using injection moulding — an expensive and complex procedure for the low volumes, specialised requirements and high complexity needed. With 3D printing (FDM), Airbus has been able to produce components with complex features like lattice structures, without any additional manufacturing cost. The result: spacer panels that are 15% lighter than panels created using traditional methods — contributing to the weight reduction of the aircraft itself.

In Automotive applications 
Ford Motor Company:  To produce high-quality parts, tooling aids are needed for manufacturing and assembly. While tooling equipment (like injection moulds, jigs and fixtures) aren’t prototypes or end parts, they remain a vital element of the production process. With 3D printing technologies like FDM and SLS, automotive companies are able to produce tooling aids at a fraction of the cost, greatly increasing efficiency on the factory floor. Tooling can also be customised for improved functionality at a significantly lower cost than conventional methods.
Porsche: Inventory costs constitute a significant proportion of expenditure for many automotive OEMs and suppliers. Within conventional manufacturing, mass producing spare parts is commonplace. However, this often leads to long delivery times and high 
inventory costs.
Additive manufacturing has the potential to transform the way spare parts are manufactured and distributed — through on-demand manufacturing. This means that parts are produced locally, at the time of need. Coordinating supply and demand in this way could not only drastically reduce inventory costs, but also slash delivery times to the end customer.

BMW: One of the major barriers to using additive manufacturing for production is the high production volumes typically required for the automotive industry (over 100,000 parts per year). However, recent years have seen great improvements in the speed and size of industrial printers as well as greater material availability. As a result, AM is becoming a viable manufacturing option for certain medium-size production runs, particularly in areas like motorsports and luxury vehicles, where production numbers are lower than average. With over 1 million parts 3D-printed in the last decade, BMW finds itself among the industry’s frontrunners when it comes to additive manufacturing.

In Medical applications:
Clear aligners: Clear aligners are dental devices used to adjust and straighten teeth. It is estimated that the majority of clear aligners are currently produced using 3D-printed moulds. The key technologies enabling this are Stereolithography (SLA) and Material Jetting, due to their high speed and accuracy. In addition to these resin-based processes, HP’s powder-based technology, Multi Jet Fusion, is also gaining traction. 
Digital dentistry: the introduction of digital technologies in dental practice – is transforming the dental sector. Traditional processes used to create dental impressions are gradually being replaced by digital technologies, with desktop 3D printing systems, 3D scanners and materials becoming more accessible. By combining intraoral scanning and 3D printing, dental labs can create dental products like crowns, bridges and bite splints, that perfectly match a patient’s anatomy.
Prosthetics: has revolutionized the field of prosthetics by opening up new opportunities for customization, allowing patients with amputations and limb differences to access devices tailored to their needs. As a result of these advantages (Customization, Complexity, Weight reduction, Reduced costs), additive manufacturing is playing an increasingly important role in the development of new and innovative prosthetic devices.
